    <h1>Jack Raines</h1>
    
    <p>Hello there and welcome to my world. If you ended up here, I figure you are probably at least somewhat interested in "Jack Raines," so I'll tell you about him.</p>
    
    <p>I live in New York. I spend a lot of time in San Francisco. I'm from Georgia. I lived in Argentina for a few months, one time. Incredible food there, let me tell you.</p>
    
    <p>I've been writing a Substack called Young Money since 2021. It was, initially, a finance blog, but now it's the home of all of my long-form writing, from ~60+ travel blogs detailing my shenanigans abroad in my early/mid 20s to my more philosophical thoughts on life.</p>
    
    <p>I regularly post satirical content on LinkedIn for my own entertainment.</p>
    
    <p>I wrote a book, also called "Young Money," about living intentionally in your 20s.</p>
    
    <p>I work for an early-stage venture capital fund called <a href="https://slow.co/">Slow Ventures</a>. We have fun. If you're building something interesting, bang my line at <a href="mailto:jack@slow.co">jack@slow.co</a>.</p>
